This project focuses on analyzing student feedback collected after a college event to evaluate overall satisfaction, identify strengths and weaknesses, and suggest actionable improvements. Survey responses were analyzed using Python-based data analytics and sentiment techniques to uncover meaningful insights that support better academic and event planning decisions.

The project was completed as Task 3 during an internship with Future Interns.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze student satisfaction trends using survey data

Evaluate different aspects such as teaching quality, course structure, and student support

Perform sentiment analysis on feedback data

Visualize insights to support data-driven decision-making

Provide recommendations to improve future college events

📊 Key Metrics Analyzed

Overall Satisfaction Score

Teaching Quality Score

Course Design Score

Support Quality Score

Question-wise Average Ratings

Sentiment Distribution (Positive / Neutral / Negative)

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python – Core data analysis

Google Colab – Development environment

Pandas & NumPy – Data cleaning and manipulation

Seaborn & Matplotlib – Data visualization

VADER Sentiment Analyzer – NLP-based sentiment (demonstration)

Google Forms (CSV) – Survey data collection

🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of student feedback collected through Google Forms, primarily containing numeric ratings on a scale of 1–10.

Key Fields:

Student ID

Well versed with the subject

Explains concepts in an understandable way

Use of presentations

Degree of difficulty of assignments

Solves doubts willingly

Structuring of the course

Provides support for students going above and beyond

Course recommendation based on relevance

📈 Analysis Workflow
🔹 Step 1: Data Cleaning & Preparation

Removed unnecessary index columns

Checked for duplicates and missing values

Validated rating ranges (1–10)

🔹 Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Calculated average ratings per question

Computed overall satisfaction scores

Grouped feedback into Teaching Quality, Course Design, and Support Quality

🔹 Step 3: Visualization

Bar charts for question-wise average ratings

Histogram of overall satisfaction distribution

Correlation heatmap to identify key influencing factors

Sentiment distribution charts

🔹 Step 4: Sentiment Analysis

Mapped numeric ratings into sentiment categories:

Positive (8–10)

Neutral (4–7)

Negative (1–3)

Demonstrated NLP-based sentiment analysis using VADER on sample text feedback

✅ Key Insights

Majority of students reported a positive overall satisfaction with the event

Teaching clarity and doubt resolution showed strong correlation with satisfaction

Assignment difficulty and course structure indicated scope for improvement

Student support played a significant role in shaping overall perception

📌 Outcome

This project demonstrates the application of data analytics, survey analysis, and visualization techniques to convert raw feedback into actionable insights. The findings can help organizers and educators improve the effectiveness of future college events and academic programs.
